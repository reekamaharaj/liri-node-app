# liri-node-app

-- Homework assignment --
### Overview

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Create and use a standard GitHub repository. As this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. This time you'll need to include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots/GIFs or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the `README.md` file should meet the following criteria:

1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app
7. State your role in the app development
